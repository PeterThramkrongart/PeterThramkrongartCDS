  {"id":"blei_latent_2003","abstract":"We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.","author":[{"family":"Blei","given":"David M."},{"family":"Ng","given":"Andrew Y."},{"family":"Jordan","given":"Michael I."}],"container-title":"The Journal of Machine Learning Research","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"jelodar_latent_2019","abstract":"Topic modeling is one of the most powerful techniques in text mining for data mining, latent data discovery, and finding relationships among data and text documents. Researchers have published many articles in the field of topic modeling and applied in various fields such as software engineering, political science, medical and linguistic science, etc. There are various methods for topic modelling; Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is one of the most popular in this field. Researchers have proposed various models based on the LDA in topic modeling. According to previous work, this paper will be very useful and valuable for introducing LDA approaches in topic modeling. In this paper, we investigated highly scholarly articles (between 2003 to 2016) related to topic modeling based on LDA to discover the research development, current trends and intellectual structure of topic modeling. In addition, we summarize challenges and introduce famous tools and datasets in topic modeling based on LDA.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Jelodar","given":"Hamed"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yongli"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Chi"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Xia"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Xiahui"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yanchao"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Liang"}],"container-title":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","container-title-short":"Multimed Tools Appl","DOI":"10.1007/s11042-018-6894-4","ISSN":"1573-7721","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"15169-15211","source":"Springer Link","title":"Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and topic modeling: models, applications, a survey","title-short":"Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and topic modeling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-018-6894-4","volume":"78"},
